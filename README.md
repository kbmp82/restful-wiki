Project demonstrating use of RESTful API and node.js

These files are a result of training I have completed during a 50 hour Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy in order to sharpen my skill and improve my knowledge. 

This particular project encompases the use of Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, EJS, and express and a RESTful API
